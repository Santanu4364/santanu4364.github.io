    <h1>Descriptive Statistics and Counting Principles</h1>
    <p><em>This document provides a comprehensive introduction to descriptive statistics, data classification, measures
            of central tendency and dispersion, and fundamental counting principles including permutations and
            combinations.</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Statistics</h2>
    <p>Statistics is the art of learning from data, involving the collection, description, and analysis of data to draw
        conclusions.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Population and Sample</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Population:</strong> The entire collection of elements of interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample:</strong> A subgroup of the population selected for detailed study.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> In a study of house prices in Tamil Nadu, all houses in Tamil Nadu
        constitute the population, while 1000 randomly selected houses from urban areas form the sample.</div>

    <h3>1.2 Branches of Statistics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Focuses on describing and summarizing data, often using numerical
            or graphical summaries to highlight main points. This can be applied to both sample and population data.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To examine and explore information about collected data only.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Calculating the average marks of a class of 50 students.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Involves drawing conclusions or making inferences about a
            population based on data obtained from a sample.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To use sample information to draw conclusions about the population.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A teacher uses the average marks of a sample of students to conclude the average
            marks of all students in the school.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data</h2>
    <p>Data are facts and figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for presentation and interpretation. Data is
        typically collected to understand characteristics or attributes of groups of people, places, things, or events.
    </p>

    <h3>2.1 Types of Data Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> Data not organized in a predefined manner, often text-heavy, and
            requires more effort to process. Examples include YouTube comments, image files, and social media posts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Data organized in a standardized, clearly defined, and searchable format,
            making it easy to analyze and understand. It typically appears in tabular form.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A student dataset with columns for Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Marks, and Board.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Variables and Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Case (Observation):</strong> A unit for which data is collected, uniquely identifying each row in a
            dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Variable:</strong> A characteristic or attribute that varies across all units.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> In a student dataset, each student (e.g., Anjali, Pradeep) is a case,
        while "Name," "Gender," "Date of Birth," and "Board" are variables.<br>In a tabular format, rows represent cases
        (same attribute recorded for each), and columns represent variables (same type of value recorded for each case).
    </div>

    <h3>2.3 Classification of Data</h3>
    <p>Data is broadly classified into categorical and numerical types.</p>

    <h4>2.3.1 Categorical Data (Qualitative Variables)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifies group membership.</li>
        <li>Meaningful mathematical operations cannot be performed on it.</li>
        <li>Examples: Gender (F, M), Board (State Board, ICSE, CBSE).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2.3.2 Numerical Data (Quantitative Variables)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Describes numerical properties, allowing mathematical operations.</li>
        <li>Requires common measurement units (e.g., weights in kilograms, prices in rupees).</li>
        <li>Example: Marks obtained by students.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2.3.3 Time-series and Cross-sectional Data</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time-series Data:</strong> Recorded over a period of time for a single entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Temperature in Delhi for seven different days.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-sectional Data:</strong> Observed at the same time for several entities.</li>
        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Temperature of Delhi, Chennai, Jaipur, and Bhopal on a particular day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2.3.4 Scales of Measurement</h4>
    <p>There are four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nominal Scale:</strong> Data consists of labels or names used to identify characteristics. No
            inherent order or ranking. Can be numerically coded, but the numbers have no mathematical meaning beyond
            identification.<br>Examples: Name, Board, Gender, Blood group, Hair color, Brand name of mobile phone,
            Number plate of cars.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordinal Scale:</strong> Possesses properties of nominal data, but the order or rank of data is
            meaningful. Differences between categories are not necessarily equal or meaningful.<br>Example: Customer
            service ratings (excellent, good, poor) can be ordered, but the difference between "good" and "excellent"
            isn't quantifiable as the difference between "good" and "bad".</li>
        <li><strong>Interval Scale:</strong> Has all properties of ordinal data, and the interval between values is
            expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Always numeric, and differences between values are
            meaningful. Ratios of values have no meaning because the value of zero is arbitrary (no absolute
            zero).<br>Example: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. A 20°C difference is meaningful, but 40°C is not
            "twice as hot" as 20°C.</li>
        <li><strong>Ratio Scale:</strong> Has all properties of interval data, and the ratio of two values is
            meaningful. Possesses an absolute zero property, meaning zero indicates the complete absence of the
            characteristic. Allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>Examples: Height (in cm),
            Weight (in kg), Marks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Describing Categorical Data</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Frequency Distribution</h3>
    <p>A frequency distribution for qualitative data lists distinct values and their frequencies. Each row in a
        frequency table shows a category and the number of cases in that category.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Relative Frequency</h3>
    <p>The relative frequency is the ratio of a category's frequency to the total number of observations. It provides a
        standard for comparison between 0 and 1.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Charts of Categorical Data</h3>
    <p>The most common displays for categorical variables are bar charts and pie charts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> A circle divided into pieces proportional to the relative frequencies of
            qualitative data. Best for comparing parts of a whole, especially when one category makes up more than half.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Displays distinct values on a horizontal axis and frequencies/relative
            frequencies on a vertical axis. Bars represent frequency/relative frequency, with height proportional to the
            value. Bars should not touch. Appropriate for representing counts of categories and comparing different
            groups. For ordinal variables, the bar chart must preserve the ordering.</li>
        <li><strong>Pareto Chart:</strong> A bar chart where categories are sorted by frequency in descending order.
            Popular in quality control to identify problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Stacked Bar Chart:</strong> Represents counts for a category, with each bar further segmented to
            show frequencies of subcategories within it.</li>
        <li><strong>100% Stacked Bar Chart:</strong> Useful for visualizing part-to-whole relationships by showing
            proportions within each category.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.4 The Area Principle and Misleading Graphs</h3>
    <p>The Area Principle states that the area occupied by a part of a graph should correspond to the amount of data it
        represents. Violations of this principle are common ways to mislead with statistics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decorated Graphs: Charts with unnecessary decorations can violate the area principle by distorting visual
            representation.</li>
        <li>Truncated Graphs: Bar charts where the baseline is not at zero can exaggerate differences.</li>
        <li>Manipulated Y-axis: Expanding or compressing the y-axis scale can make changes in data seem less or more
            significant than they are.</li>
        <li>Round-off Errors: Occur when percentages or proportions in tables are rounded, causing the total sum to
            slightly differ from 100% or 1, which can lead to inaccuracies in pie charts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.5 Summarizing Categorical Data</h3>
    <p>Descriptive measures are quantities that summarize a dataset. Measures of central tendency indicate the center or
        most typical value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most common category in a categorical variable (highest frequency). Corresponds
            to the longest bar in a bar chart, the widest slice in a pie chart, and the first category in a Pareto
            chart. Bimodal/Multimodal Data: If two (bimodal) or more (multimodal) categories tie for the highest
            frequency. Can be defined for both nominal and ordinal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Median:</strong> For an ordinal variable, it is the category of the middle observation after sorting
            the values. If an even number of observations, either category on either side of the middle can be chosen as
            the median. Can only be defined for ordinal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Describing Numerical Data</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Types of Variables</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discrete Variable:</strong> Involves a count of something. Examples: Number of people in a
            household, number of spelling mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Variable:</strong> Involves a measurement of something. Examples: Weight of a person,
            height, speed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Organizing Numerical Data</h3>
    <p>Numerical data can be organized by grouping observations into classes (categories or bins) and then constructing
        frequency and relative-frequency distributions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Organizing Discrete Data (single value): If few distinct values, use a frequency table where each class is a
            distinct value.</li>
        <li>Organizing Continuous Data: Number of Classes: Typically 5 to 20 classes. Each observation must belong to
            exactly one class. Class intervals are often of equal length.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Terminology:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lower Class Limit: Smallest value in a class</li>
        <li>Upper Class Limit: Largest value in a class</li>
        <li>Class Width: Difference between lower limits of consecutive classes</li>
        <li>Class Mark: Average of the two class limits</li>
        <li>A class interval usually contains its left-end but not its right-end boundary point.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Stem-and-leaf Diagram (Stemplot)</h3>
    <p>A stem-and-leaf diagram separates each observation into a stem (all but the rightmost digit) and a leaf (the
        rightmost digit).</p>
    <p>Construction Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate observations into stem and leaf.</li>
        <li>Write stems vertically, smallest to largest, to the left of a vertical rule.</li>
        <li>Write each leaf to the right of the rule in its appropriate stem row.</li>
        <li>Arrange leaves in each row in ascending order.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4.4 Descriptive Measures for Numerical Data</h3>

    <h4>4.4.1 Measures of Central Tendency</h4>

    <strong>Mean:</strong>
    <p>The sum of observations divided by the number of observations; commonly referred to as the average.</p>
    <p>Formulas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sample mean: <span class="formula">\(\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}\)</span></li>
        <li>Population mean: <span class="formula">\(\mu = \frac{\sum x_i}{N}\)</span></li>
        <li>Grouped discrete data: <span class="formula">\(\bar{x} = \frac{\sum f_i x_i}{n}\)</span></li>
        <li>Grouped continuous data: <span class="formula">\(\bar{x} = \frac{\sum f_i m_i}{n}\)</span> (where <span
                class="formula">\(m_i\)</span> is midpoint of class interval)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Effect of Constants:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding a constant <span class="formula">\(c\)</span>: New mean = Old mean + <span
                class="formula">\(c\)</span></li>
        <li>Multiplying by a constant <span class="formula">\(c\)</span>: New mean = Old mean <span
                class="formula">\(\times c\)</span></li>
        <li>Sensitivity: Sensitive to outliers.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Median:</strong>
    <p>The middle value in an ordered dataset, dividing the bottom 50% from the top 50%.</p>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange data in increasing order.</li>
        <li>If <span class="formula">\(n\)</span> is odd, median is the <span class="formula">\(\frac{n+1}{2}\)</span>th
            observation.</li>
        <li>If <span class="formula">\(n\)</span> is even, median is the mean of the <span
                class="formula">\(\frac{n}{2}\)</span>th and <span class="formula">\(\frac{n}{2}+1\)</span>th
            observations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Effect of Constants: Adding <span class="formula">\(c\)</span> → +<span class="formula">\(c\)</span>; Multiplying
        by <span class="formula">\(c\)</span> → <span class="formula">\(\times c\)</span>. Not sensitive to outliers.
    </p>

    <strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.<br>Effect of Constants: Adding <span
        class="formula">\(c\)</span> → +<span class="formula">\(c\)</span>; Multiplying by <span
        class="formula">\(c\)</span> → <span class="formula">\(\times c\)</span>.

    <h4>4.4.2 Measures of Dispersion (Variability/Spread)</h4>

    <strong>Range:</strong>
    <p>The difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.</p>
    <p>Formula: Range = Max - Min<br>Sensitivity: Highly sensitive to outliers as it only considers extreme values.</p>

    <strong>Variance:</strong>
    <p>Measures the variability by considering deviations of data values from the central value. Takes into account all
        observations.</p>
    <p>Formulas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Population variance: <span class="formula">\(\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}\)</span></li>
        <li>Sample variance: <span class="formula">\(s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}\)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Units: Expressed in square units of the original variable.</p>
    <p>Effect of Constants:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding <span class="formula">\(c\)</span>: New variance = Old variance (no change)</li>
        <li>Multiplying by <span class="formula">\(c\)</span>: New variance = <span class="formula">\(c^2
                \times\)</span> Old variance</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Standard Deviation:</strong>
    <p>The square root of the variance.</p>

        <li>Sample: <span class="formula">\(s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Units: Expressed in the same units as the original data.</p>
    <p>Effect of Constants:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding <span class="formula">\(c\)</span>: No change</li>
        <li>Multiplying by <span class="formula">\(c\)</span>: New sd = <span class="formula">\( |c| \times\)</span> Old
            sd</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.5 Percentiles</h3>
    <p>The sample <span class="formula">\(100p\)</span> percentile is the data value such that at least <span
            class="formula">\(100p\%\)</span> of the data are ≤ it, and at least <span
            class="formula">\(100(1-p)\%\)</span> are ≥ it.</p>
    <p>Computing Percentiles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange data in increasing order.</li>
        <li>Calculate <span class="formula">\(np\)</span>.</li>
        <li>If <span class="formula">\(np\)</span> not integer → smallest integer greater than <span
                class="formula">\(np\)</span></li>
        <li>If <span class="formula">\(np\)</span> integer → average of positions <span class="formula">\(np\)</span>
            and <span class="formula">\(np+1\)</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4.6 Quartiles</h3>
    <p>Quartiles divide a dataset into four equal parts using three values.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First Quartile (Q1): 25th percentile</li>
        <li>Second Quartile (Q2): 50th percentile = Median</li>
        <li>Third Quartile (Q3): 75th percentile</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.7 Five Number Summary</h3>
    <p>Minimum – Q1 – Median – Q3 – Maximum</p>

    <h3>4.8 Interquartile Range (IQR)</h3>
    <p>IQR = Q3 − Q1</p>

    <h2>5. Association Between Two Variables</h2>
    <p>Association between two variables means that knowing information about one variable provides information about
        the other.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Association Between Two Categorical Variables</h3>
    <p>To find associations, a contingency table is used.<br>Rule: If row relative frequencies (or column relative
        frequencies) are the same for all rows (or columns), the variables are not associated. If they differ, the
        variables are associated.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Association Between Two Numerical Variables</h3>
    <p>A scatter plot is a visual test for association between two numerical variables, displaying pairs of values as
        points on a two-dimensional plane.</p>
    <p>Describing Association: Direction (upward, downward, no trend), Curvature (linear, curved), Variation (tightly
        clustered or not), Outliers.</p>

    <h4>5.2.1 Measures of Association for Numerical Variables</h4>

    <strong>Covariance:</strong>
    <p>Quantifies the strength of the linear association between two numerical variables.</p>
    <p>Formulas:</p>
    <ul>

    <h3>5.3 Association Between Categorical and Numerical Variables</h3>
    <p><strong>Point Bi-serial Correlation Coefficient (\(r_{pb}\)):</strong> Measures association between a numerical
        variable (X) and a dichotomous categorical variable (Y, e.g. 0 or 1).</p>

    <h2>6. Basic Principle of Counting</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Addition Rule of Counting</h3>
    <p>If action A can occur in <span class="formula">\(n_1\)</span> ways and action B in <span
            class="formula">\(n_2\)</span> ways, and A and B cannot occur simultaneously, then total ways = <span
            class="formula">\(n_1 + n_2\)</span>.</p>
    <div class="example">Choosing one item (shirt or pant) from 4 shirts and 3 pants → 4 + 3 = 7 choices.</div>

    <h3>6.2 Multiplication Rule of Counting</h3>
    <p>If action A in <span class="formula">\(n_1\)</span> ways and action B in <span class="formula">\(n_2\)</span>
        ways, then both → <span class="formula">\(n_1 \times n_2\)</span>.</p>
    <div class="example">Choosing one shirt (4) AND one pant (3) → 4 × 3 = 12 combinations.</div>

    <h2>7. Factorial</h2>
    <p><span class="formula">\(n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1\)</span><br>By convention <span
            class="formula">\(0! = 1\)</span><br><span class="formula">\(n! = n \times (n-1)!\)</span></p>

    <h2>8. Permutation</h2>
    <p>A permutation is an ordered arrangement of all or some of n distinct objects. Order matters.</p>

    <h3>8.1 Permutation Formula (No Repetition)</h3>
    <p><span class="formula">\(P(n,r) = {}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\)</span></p>
    <p>Special cases: <span class="formula">\(^nP_0 = 1\), \(^nP_1 = n\), \(^nP_n = n!\)</span></p>

    <h3>8.2 Permutation Formula (With Repetition)</h3>
    <p><span class="formula">\(n^r\)</span></p>

    <h3>8.3 Rearranging Letters (with Identical Items)</h3>
    <p>One kind identical: <span class="formula">\(\frac{n!}{p!}\)</span><br>Multiple kinds: <span
            class="formula">\(\frac{n!}{p_1! \, p_2! \cdots p_k!}\)</span></p>

    <h3>8.4 Circular Permutation</h3>
    <p>Clockwise ≠ anticlockwise: <span class="formula">\((n-1)!\)</span><br>Clockwise = anticlockwise: <span
            class="formula">\(\frac{(n-1)!}{2}\)</span></p>

    <h2>9. Combination</h2>
    <p>A combination is a selection of r objects from n distinct objects where order does not matter.</p>

    <h3>9.1 Combination Formula</h3>
    <p><span class="formula">\({}^nC_r = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\)</span></p>
    <p>Properties: <span class="formula">\({}^nC_r = {}^nC_{n-r}\), {}^nC_0 = {}^nC_n = 1</span></p>

    <h3>9.2 Distinguishing Permutation vs. Combination</h3>
    <p>Permutation → order matters (e.g. medals)<br>Combination → order does not matter (e.g. committee)</p>

    <h3>9.3 Drawing Lines in a Circle</h3>
    <p>Undirected lines: <span class="formula">\({}^nC_2\)</span><br>Directed lines: <span
            class="formula">\({}^nP_2\)</span></p>
